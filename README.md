# kNNinpython

Simple model of kNN built to practice and enrich understanding of the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm from CSC311.

KNN_sklearn uses the sklearn library while kNN_scratch.py was coded from scratch 

The two models uses a dataset of an Iris flower of 4 different categories with 4 attributes. 
2/3 of the data was split for training and the other 1/3 for testing, where the split of data was random. 

The accuracy of the two models can be seen in the following image:
